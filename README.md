# Building an application using devise
 
> I created a Ruby on Rails application for a site where users can create accounts and posts.

- Consists of two models: user and post, two controllers: home and posts, two main views: home and posts.
- User authentication was built using the devise gem.
- A user can see the posts view, but need to be signed in to be able to see the post's author name.
- A user must be logged in to be able to edit or delete her/his posts.
- A user can edit her/his account information, and delete her/his account.
- Works on the browser.

## Built With
- Ruby (v. 3.0.0)
- Ruby on Rails (v. 6.1.1)
- devise gem
- Rubocop
